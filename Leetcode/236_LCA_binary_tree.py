#  time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case, we might have to visit all nodes.
# space complexity: O(H) where H is the height of the binary tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), H can be O(N). In a balanced tree, H is O(log N).
